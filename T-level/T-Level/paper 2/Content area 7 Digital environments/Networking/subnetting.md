subnetting is the division of your local network.

A local networks Ip is split into 4 Octet 

| Optec: | 1        | 2        | 3        | 4        |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| IP     | 192      | 168      | 0        | 0        |
| BInary | 11000000 | 10101000 | 00000000 | 00000000 |

by default all computers are on one subnet or network 
to split a network you need to steal bits form  another octet. the formular for this is subnets = 2^bits stolen, However this leaves less bits for the devices to be assigned
